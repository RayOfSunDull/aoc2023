# Advent Of Code 2023

These are my solutions to some of the AOC2023 problems. In order to run them, you need [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/). First, compile the run script:
```sh
sbcl --script run.lisp
```
Then, run any of the day codes as such:
```sh
./run day problem
```
where `day` is the number of the day and `problem` is either 1 or 2.
